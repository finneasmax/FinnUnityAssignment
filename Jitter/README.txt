Here is that jitter patch that's been behaving strangely. I copied this patch from Amazing Max Stuff.

The image looks ok but but jit.world is consistently running between 20 and 30 FPS.

Sadly I think it's my computer and not the patch. This is because the same behavior was happening with my jitter final last spring.

My computer was low on storage space so I thought that might be the problem. Now I have about 40% free storage and the problem persists.

I remember that for some reason me and one or two other people in the jitter class we're never able to get jit.time to work. So I made a subpatch called finn.time. I was worried that might be messing up my final patch somehow, but that's not even in this one.
